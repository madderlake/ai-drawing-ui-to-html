#### üß† Usage

- use drawing tools to create UI elements or page
- Click the "Generate" button to send the prompt to OpenAi
- If the query is successful, the Preview Modal should open showing an image of the generated UI with a tab to view the code (HTML).

**Note**: multiple submissions of the same or slightly tweaked drawing can return different results. Apparently there are many assistants, and the prompt does allow some creative license. Feel free to tweak the prompt to your needs.
